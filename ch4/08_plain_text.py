# Exercise 4.8: Try MSWord or LibreOffice to write a program
# Author: Bruno N. Conti

"""
Software like MSWord or LibreOffice are supposed to be used for writing documents,
no for writing computer code. The reason is that these programs save a lot of other
characters besides the things that we as users write. That is why we need to use
plain text formats: they save only the things that we as programmers write.
