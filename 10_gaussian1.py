Exercise 1.10: Evaluate a Gaussian function
The bell-shaped Gaussian function,

f(x) = (1/(sqrt(2pi)s))^(-1/2*((x-m)/s)^2)

is one of the most widely used functions in science
and technology. The parameters m and s > 0 are
prescribed real numbers. Make a program for evaluating
this function when m = 0, s = 2, and x = 1. Verify the
programâ€™s result by comparing with hand calculations
on a calculator.
